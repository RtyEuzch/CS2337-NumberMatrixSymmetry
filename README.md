This project is for the course CS2337, a C++-based course on DSA. This project presents a text file, named matrix.txt, as input,
and the project, held in main.cpp, is supposed to check if the sums of the columns of the number matrices in the files are such that they
are symmetrical. 

Input consists of an initial line, with two space-delimited numbers. The first number is the number of rows; the second the columns.

--For example--
       { {3 4},
       {1 1 7  7}, 
       {4 6 1 -2}, 
       {1 1 0  2} }
sums:  6 8 8 7

* Here, the sums of the columns of the matrix are not symmetrical, since 6 and 7 are not equal. However, the two middle columns have s symmetric sums.
